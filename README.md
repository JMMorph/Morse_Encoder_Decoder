# Morse_Encoder_Decoder
This project allows to code and decode english to morse, from audio files, live audio recording and written messages
# Regarding the code
The theory behind this code is in wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code
so the Encoder and the decoder must follow these rules:

    The length of a dot "." is one unit
    The length of a line "-" is three units
    The space between parts of the same letter is one unit
    The space between letters is three units
    The space between words is seven units
